# Pyxel Doom
Pyxel Doom is a simple 2D game inspired by the classic Doom game. It is written in Python using the Pyxel library.
Its rendering engine is a 2.5D renderer, which means that it uses 2D graphics to represent a 3D world.
The game is still in development, but it is already playable. You can move around the map, change rendering modes, and change resolution.
The game is also open-source, so feel free to contribute to the project.
